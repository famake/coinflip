# coin-images

Place optimized JPG/PNG files here and reference them from the app using relative URLs such as `/coin-images/athens-obv.jpg`.

Most local dev servers (Python `http.server`, `npx http-server`, VS Code Live Server, etc.) automatically expose this folder, so the browser can load the files without external hosting. Keep filenames web-safe (letters, numbers, dashes, underscores) to avoid encoding issues.
